# Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategies

## 📊 Project Overview
This data analysis project identifies key drivers of customer churn and develops actionable retention strategies. The analysis reveals that **payment methods and contract types** are primary factors influencing customer attrition, with electronic check users showing 45% churn rates and month-to-month contracts at 42% churn.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Payment Method Impact**: Electronic check users churn at 45% - three times higher than credit card users (15%)
- **Contract Type Critical**: Two-year contracts reduce churn to just 3% compared to 42% for month-to-month
- **First-Year Risk**: 50% of churn occurs in the first year of customer tenure
- **Senior Vulnerability**: Customers aged 65+ show 41% churn rate vs 26% for younger demographics

## 💡 Business Recommendations
1. **Promote Long-Term Contracts**: Incentivize yearly commitments to reduce churn from 42% to single digits
2. **Payment Method Migration**: Transition customers from electronic checks to secure payment options
3. **First-Year Engagement**: Implement strong onboarding and retention programs for new customers
4. **Senior-Focused Initiatives**: Create personalized assistance programs for the 65+ demographic

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Methods**: Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, predictive modeling
- **Deliverables**: Analysis notebook, strategic recommendations, visualization dashboards
